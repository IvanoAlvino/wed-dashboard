2. **Search UI Components**:
   - Material Design search field with outline appearance
   - Search icon prefix and clear button suffix
   - Search results counter showing filtered talk count
   - "No results" state with clear search option

3. **Search Logic**:
   - Case-insensitive title matching using `toLowerCase()`
   - Preserves day grouping structure in filtered results
   - Maintains chronological sorting within filtered results
   - Empty search term shows all talks (no filtering)

4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - **Search Highlighting**: Matched terms highlighted with yellow background
   - **Result Feedback**: Shows count of matching talks
   - **Clear Functionality**: Easy search reset with clear button
   - **No Results State**: User-friendly message when no matches found

### Key Methods Added
- `setupSearch()`: Initializes reactive search with debouncing
- `applySearch()`: Applies current search term to talk data
- `filterTalks()`: Core filtering logic for title matching
- `highlightMatch()`: HTML highlighting of search terms in results
- `clearSearch()`: Resets search state and shows all talks
- `getTotalFilteredTalks()`: Counts total filtered results across all days

### Search State Management
- `searchControl`: FormControl for reactive form handling
- `searchTerm`: Current search string for highlighting and logic
- `filteredTalksByDate`: Filtered version of original talk data
- Maintains separate filtered and original data structures

### User Experience Features
- **Instant Feedback**: Search results update as user types (with debouncing)
- **Visual Highlighting**: Search terms highlighted in yellow in talk titles
- **Result Count**: Shows "Found X talks matching 'search term'"
- **Clear Search**: Prominent clear button when search is active
- **No Results Handling**: Friendly message with option to clear search
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features (rating, expand, etc.) work with filtered results

### Performance Considerations
- **Client-side Filtering**: No additional API calls for search
- **Debounced Input**: 300ms delay prevents excessive processing
- **Efficient Filtering**: Simple string matching without complex algorithms
- **Preserved Data Structure**: Maintains day grouping and sorting

## Popular Talks Feature Implementation Details

**Recently Added**: Complete popular talks ranking system that displays talks with at least one vote, ordered by popularity with sophisticated sorting logic.

### Backend Implementation
1. **New Repository Query**: `findTalksWithRatingsOrderByPopularity()`
   - Uses complex JPQL query with subqueries for sorting
   - Primary sort: Average rating (descending)
   - Secondary sort: Rating count (descending) for ties
   - Filters to only include talks with at least one rating

2. **New API Endpoint**: `/api/talks/popular`
   - Returns `List<TalkResponse>` with same structure as other endpoints
   - Includes user's personal rating if authenticated
   - Maintains consistent DTO pattern

### Frontend Implementation
1. **New Component**: `PopularTalksComponent`
   - Location: `frontend/src/app/components/popular-talks/`

2. **Loading State**: Spinner with descriptive text
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent snackbar notifications
4. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and animations
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Frontend Code Refactoring Implementation Details

### Refactoring Overview
**Recently Completed**: Comprehensive refactoring of all Angular components to separate inline templates and styles into individual files, following Angular best practices for better code organization and maintainability.

### Components Refactored
1. **StarRatingComponent**: Small, focused component for rating display and interaction
2. **LoginComponent**: Authentication form with Material Design styling
3. **TalkListComponent**: Main conference schedule with complex layout and search functionality
4. **PopularTalksComponent**: Popular talks ranking page with similar complexity to talk-list

### File Structure Changes
**Before Refactoring**: All components used inline templates and styles
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `<div>...</div>`,
  styles: [`div { ... }`]
})
```

**After Refactoring**: External template and style files
```typescript
@Component({
  templateUrl: './component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./component.component.scss']
})
```

### Files Created During Refactoring
**Template Files (.html)**:
- `frontend/src/app/components/star-rating/star-rating.component.html`
- `frontend/src/app/components/login/login.component.html`
- `frontend/src/app/components/talk-list/talk-list.component.html`
- `frontend/src/app/components/popular-talks/popular-talks.component.html`

**Style Files (.scss)**:
- `frontend/src/app/components/star-rating/star-rating.component.scss`
- `frontend/src/app/components/login/login.component.scss`
- `frontend/src/app/components/talk-list/talk-list.component.scss`
- `frontend/src/app/components/popular-talks/popular-talks.component.scss`

### Technical Implementation Details
1. **Template Extraction**: Moved all `template: \`...\`` content to separate `.html` files
   - Removed template string backticks and formatting
   - Maintained proper HTML indentation and structure
   - Preserved all Angular directives, bindings, and structural directives

2. **Style Extraction**: Moved all `styles: [\`...\`]` content to separate `.scss` files
   - Removed array brackets and template string formatting
   - Maintained SCSS syntax and nesting structure
   - Preserved all CSS classes, media queries, and animations

3. **Component Decorator Updates**: Updated all @Component decorators
   - Replaced `template` property with `templateUrl`
   - Replaced `styles` property with `styleUrls`
   - Maintained all other component metadata (selector, standalone, imports, animations)

### Benefits Achieved
1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and styling cleanly separated
2. **Improved IDE Support**: Full syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and validation for HTML/SCSS
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to locate and edit templates/styles
4. **Team Collaboration**: Designers can work on templates/styles independently
5. **Code Readability**: Component TypeScript files significantly smaller and focused on logic
6. **Better Tooling**: Linting, formatting, and build tools work better with separate files

### Preserved Functionality
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality maintained
- **Component Logic**: All TypeScript logic, methods, and properties unchanged
- **Angular Features**: Animations, reactive forms, Material Design components preserved
- **Standalone Architecture**: All components remain standalone with proper imports
- **Responsive Design**: All mobile-responsive layouts and media queries maintained

### Quality Assurance
- **Template Integrity**: All HTML structure, Angular directives, and bindings preserved
- **Style Consistency**: All CSS classes, animations, and responsive breakpoints maintained
- **Component Behavior**: All user interactions, form handling, and navigation preserved
- **Material Design**: All Angular Material components and theming unchanged

### Development Impact
- **Build Process**: No changes to Angular CLI build process
- **Hot Reload**: Development server continues to work with file watching
- **Component Testing**: Easier to write unit tests with external templates
- **Code Reviews**: Smaller, focused files easier to review and understand

## Critical Knowledge for Continuity
After any memory reset, the most important context is:
1. **This is a fully functional application** - not a work in progress
2. **Demo credentials**: demo/password for immediate testing
3. **Development setup**: Both servers run independently on 8080/4200
4. **Database resets**: H2 is in-memory, restarts clean each time
5. **Key files**: Entity classes, service implementations, and component logic are complete
6. **Search functionality**: Real-time talk filtering by title with highlighting and result counts
7. **Frontend refactoring**: All components now use external template/style files for better maintainability
