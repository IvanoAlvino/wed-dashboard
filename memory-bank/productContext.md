### Use Case Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Individual Attendee
*Sarah attends 8 talks over 2 days. At the end of each talk, she quickly rates it 1-5 stars based on quality and applicability to her team's work. Later, she reviews her ratings to prepare a summary for her team.*

#### Scenario 2: Team Evaluation
*A 6-person development team sends 3 members to the conference. Each attendee rates talks throughout the event. The team lead reviews aggregate ratings to decide which talks warrant detailed presentations to the full team.*

#### Scenario 3: Cross-Team Insights
*Multiple teams use the platform to rate talks. Teams can see aggregate ratings across the organization to identify universally valuable content worth company-wide sharing.*
