The data encompassed various details about individuals, requiring the system to generate comprehensive reports, including connections and economic scoring. Traditional manual analysis by specialists could take days for a single individual. To overcome this, we implemented an AI-driven solution powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).\r\n\r\nAfter training the model and integrating it into the system, the AI now delivers reports that are up to 80% more accurate than manual reviews. This session will explore our journey in designing, training, and deploying AI in a .NET environment, addressing challenges, optimizing performance, and achieving transformative results.",

Next, you\u2019ll configure event-based messaging between two simple agents, observing how they exchange data and trigger workflows. In the third exercise, you\u2019ll integrate text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries so your agent can \u201cspeak\u201d and execute spoken commands. Finally, you\u2019ll brainstorm AI-driven, computer-using agent scenarios and see for yourself how well they execute tasks by interacting with your desktop environment. By the end of this session, you\u2019ll have practiced four distinct techniques that you can adapt and combine in your own projects. Pre-requisites - Github account - Laptop\r\n",

We will start with a very short introduction on Agentic AI and function calling and an example based on Anthropic's MCP how to create architecture descriptions and Berlin techno songs out of Confluence pages. Once we all have the demo up and running, we will wire their own APIs and SaaS APIs as additional organs building our own FrankenstAIn (sic) agent. All examples will be in Typescript and do not require any commercial licenses. Don't fear if you are not a Typescript expert: I will also show how to use a code GenAI agent  with Postman Toolgen and hack your FrankenstAIN together with you.",

The Eclipse open-source community works on the future of vector databases: a micro vector database network - inspired by the serverless microservice architecture principle. Unlike clunky, monolithic databases that waste energy running massive servers 24\/7, whether data is accessed or not, a micro vector database network dynamically allocates compute power only to the 20% of data in use, shutting down up to 80% of idle regions. The result is a blazing-fast vector search for cutting-edge GenAI solutions, slashing energy, CO2 emissions, and infrastructure costs by up to 80%.

Through a live demo of a simplified COBOL migration, I\u2019ll show how AI can accelerate key activities: reverse engineering business logic, generating documentation, creating tests, and transforming legacy code into modern architectures. We\u2019ll also examine real-world customer projects, highlighting how to reduce time-to-value, mitigate migration risks, and integrate AI responsibly into existing development workflows.

Since arguably almost every web application relies on APIs these days, it's imperative that we address them. In the talk, we'll take a look at how the list came about and then go through all the points, showcasing common attacks. In particular, we are interested in what this means for modern stacks.

Quarkus is not just useful for optimizing resource usage though. There is also a big focus on improving the developer experience.\r\nIf you\u2019re new to Quarkus or want a refresher on some of its latest features, you\u2019ll definitely want to join this session. We\u2019ll show you how to experiment with databases, kafka clusters, containers, Kubernetes, and of course, AI, without ever restarting our application. \r\nAfter this session the audience should come away with inspiration to efficiently build modern applications with Java, and have lots of fun while doing so!\"",

In practice, their implicit time constraints and sensitivity to intermittent failures present challenges. As a result, developers often abandon RPC and accept the complexity of asynchronous APIs, queues, and orchestration layers.\r\n\r\nThis session introduces Nexus RPC, a new open standard that brings the simplicity of RPC to long-running, fault-tolerant operations. Unlike traditional RPC, operations persist independently of client or service lifecycles and can be tracked, resumed, or cancelled at any point\u2014even after outages or restarts. It's RPC reimagined for the realities of modern applications.\r\n\r\nAttend this session to learn what Nexus RPC is and how it addresses fundamental challenges in distributed systems. You'll also discover why it is particularly valuable for agentic AI, as it enables LLM-powered agents to reliably invoke external tools and monitor long-running operations.",

In this workshop, we\u2019ll demystify the most dangerous and fast-evolving attack vectors that are targeting developers through the tools they trust, package managers, build systems, third-party libraries, and CI\/CD pipelines. \r\nThrough real-world case studies and code-level examples, we\u2019ll unpack how: \r\nAttackers exploit developer mistakes with typosquatting. \r\nInternal dependencies are hijacked via dependency confusion. \r\nMaintainers or compromised packages introduce malware into trusted ecosystems. \r\nObscure transitive dependencies become silent backdoors. \r\n\r\nThis session is designed for developers who want to understand the risks, recognize the signs, and start building defense-in-depth strategies. If time permits, we\u2019ll get hands-on with practical exercises where you\u2019ll see (and maybe try) some of these attack techniques in a controlled environment\u2014so you can learn how to defend against them in the wild. \r\nCome prepared to rethink your assumptions about open source and start building a more resilient development workflow. \r\n",

With the proper knowledge about well-structured architecture, refactorings for tangled code can quickly be found. Complex code can be eliminated, and maintenance costs will be reduced.\r\n",

However, the practical implications of the differences in the approaches, features, and limitations of LLMs across different cloud platforms are significant. In this session, we will compare and contrast the LLM offerings of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and provide an overview of the pros and cons of each of them. We will also explore the different options and challenges of integrating LLMs in custom applications, as well as the tooling ecosystem that each vendor provides to help developers build LLM-based solutions. Finally, we will discuss the security and safety aspects of using LLMs in the cloud, and the best practices for ensuring ethical and responsible use of generative AI. ",

            "description":"Platform Teams became a known concept for speeding up software delivery thanks to Team Topologies, which defines Platform Teams as a team focused on reducing the cognitive load of stream-aligned teams by providing reusable services, APIs, infrastructure, etc. Inspired by Team Topologies, many organizations try to implement either the whole concept or a part of it but face various challenges. One of the biggest problems is that platform teams are becoming bottlenecks. In this talk, we'll dive into systems thinking, organizational structure, stakeholder management, prioritization, and many other topics to understand how to move platform teams out of a bottleneck situation. We will talk about an example where I led the transformation of a cross-functional team into a platform team and overcame the bottleneck situation. I will share our challenges in a dynamic and changing organization, the mistakes we have made, and how we solved the bottleneck situation.",

            "description":"Microservice architecture has become a popular system design option in recent years due to its agility and scalability. Business logics are decoupled into multiple services and data can easily flow among them. However, this brings in another critical challenge in data protection - how to safeguard sensitive data while maintaining the benefits of microservices. In this talk, we will present our innovative solution to protect sensitive data lifecycle in large-scale microservice architecture. By utilizing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like encryption, pseudonymization and confidential computing technologies, our solution guarantees that sensitive data can only be accessible by minimal logics in trusted execution environments. In addition, to provide better transparency on sensitive data usage, computations can be audited and verified by external parties through the remote attestation mechanism. Finally, we will also discuss challenges and opportunities of applying PETs at scale.",

            "description":"Search is broken into 2 components at GetYourGuide. Structured and Unstructured Search. While opensearch and json gave us a lot of flexibility in schema and access to the data with simple filtering over complex json data types and aggregations, there were ofcourse tradeoffs, like performance, and complexity to manage Opensearch cluster. As well as lack of simple scalability and significant slow writes to avoid read impact. A lot more troubles that I would like to present, but more on the pros of Postgres, and how it helped us achieved a nice hybrid schema with tables that have hybrid denormalization allowing us to build a strong foundation that opened up a lot of possibilities for our Marketplace. \r\nImpact - PG is 40% faster in those queries when we compared against Opensearch.",

Employees are still expected to hide parts of themselves whether it\u2019s mental health struggles, neurodiversity, or personal challenges. Despite the focus on diversity, many workplaces aren't ready for real authenticity.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we\u2019ll explore how HR leaders and developers can move beyond good intentions to create true, lasting change. We\u2019ll focus on the how: shifting from surface-level policies to fostering a culture of empathy, support, and vulnerability. Learn how to break down stigma, normalise tough conversations, and build an inclusive environment where people can bring their full selves to work.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just about talking inclusion it\u2019s about creating workplaces where authenticity is welcomed and inclusion is woven into the culture.",

With GPT-4, ChatGPT, and new open-source developments appearing every week, there has never been a more interesting time to work with Large Language Models. However, organizations now face critical challenges: preventing data leaks, blocking hostile prompts, and ensuring brand or organizational policies remain enforced.\r\nThis session explores concrete safety practices that help teams build more secure and consistent AI-based applications. Real-life examples will highlight the types of vulnerabilities encountered in customer support chatbots, internal knowledge bases, and automated content workflows. Using frameworks like LangChain4J, Hugging Face, and OpenAI, participants will learn to:\r\nMonitor and filter inputs and outputs to deter unauthorized content and malicious activities.\r\nProtect private data with targeted access controls, making sure sensitive information remains confidential.\r\nAddress risks in retrieval-based tasks that could compromise data accuracy.\r\nMaintain responsible permissions and ongoing reviews so systems stay within intended parameters after release.\r\nAttendees will see live demonstrations of protective measures and gain practical insights for applying these methods throughout product development. The session closes with a look at the shifting landscape of LLM safety and the strategies needed to adapt as more sophisticated threats arise. It is intended for developers, security experts, and project leads seeking to deploy AI-driven features while preserving user and organizational security.",

Or rather: Its engineers voluntarily use and contribute to GetDX. It functions like an engagement survey (with much greater detail): It collects feedback and sentiment, providing insights into what could or should be improved within the engineering department to ensure high engagement and an excellent workflow. GetDX evaluates the urgency and importance of upcoming issues, helping to prioritize tasks. \r\n\r\nThe fewer minor issues one encounters, the easier it is to work faster, more precisely, and more productively. Because, if engineers are happy, the company benefits as a whole. One of the key figures is the Developer Experience Index (DEI) - the higher it is, the happier engineers are. Response rates are extremely high (ca 95%). Why? Because it's about seeing tangible actions taken based on the feedback.",

We built a lot of such features into different software, with transcription, commands, live feedback, different services, that made us sometimes feel superhuman and sometimes humbled us down.\r\nSo, after three years, its time for a recap - I'll show real results, talk about (exactly) how we made it, what the customers liked about it and what they disliked. I'll show the differences between commercial and self-hosted, discuss prompting, fine-tuning and when-not-to-finetune.\r\nI'll talk about the time we needed to add those functionalities, and how well it did work - and the talk will be kept up-to-date until the last week before the event ;)",

APIs like Google Maps, Twitter, and Flickr gave developers access to data they could use to create interactive user experiences that were simply delightful. However, the excitement eventually fizzled as developers realized they had to maintain these applications which were often just fun side projects.\r\n\r\nNow, 20 years later, that excitement and curiosity has returned with the introduction of AI Agents. With the MCP (Model Context Protocol) open standard, developers can integrate data and functionality from multiple services without the burden of maintaining full systems. By connecting AI agents to various APIs, resources, and data sources, we get quick modern-day mashups.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore how AI Agents are bringing fun and creativity back to software development and giving new life to the \u201cprogrammable web\u201d.\r\n",

            "description":"In an era where generative AI can write the perfect resume for your job description, the traditional methods of identifying top tech (and any) talent are failing. How can you be sure you're hiring for genuine skill and not wasting your time on just prompt engineering? \r\n\r\nThe answer lies in a strategic shift you can make easily: moving to a skills-based hiring model.\r\n\r\nThis session is a practical playbook for HR and Talent Acquisition leaders navigating this new landscape. We will cut through the noise to provide a clear, step-by-step framework for implementing skills-based hiring. You'll learn how to replace high-volume, low-accuracy resume screens with high-fidelity job simulations that reveal a candidate's true abilities. We'll cover how to design assessments that are not only resistant to AI cheating but can also help you identify the candidates who leverage AI as a powerful productivity tool. \r\n\r\nLeave this session ready to build a faster, fairer, and more predictive tech (And any other role) hiring process.",

            "description":"Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is an established and important methodological tool widely used in manufacturing to determine the causes of repeating machine breakdowns, defects or to improve overall efficiency. Traditionally, specialists may use quality management tools like 5-Why and Ishikawa diagrams or statistical methods to systematically identify and address the underlying causes. With increasing digitalization, more and more data are being collected providing a good basis for systematic data driven analysis. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to extract valuable insights from this data. Today's established methods today are reaching their limits dealing with the sheer amount of data and the complex, non-linear interrelationships of modern manufacturing processes and process chains. To navigate these complexities, the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) and causal discovery techniques offers promising avenues for enhancing RCA. XAI provides transparency in machine learning models, enabling practitioners to gain impulses from inspecting how a model uses the data. Meanwhile, causal discovery focuses on distinguishing between mere statistical associations and genuine causal relationships, allowing for the identification of causal paths. This talk will provide an overview of these methodologies, discussing their application in root cause analysis, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present in improving decision-making processes.

Drawing from real-world case studies and hard-won experience, we'll examine what works, what *doesn't*, and, most importantly, what's *missing* in current API implementations.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just about choosing the right tool for today.  It's about envisioning the APIs of tomorrow.  By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols, we'll explore the key ingredients for future API success.

            "description":"Classical software development is a relay race across layers - DB schemas, backend DTOs, API specs, front-end types - where every hand-off risks a dropped baton. Low-code promises speed but collapses at scale; no-code can\u2019t express nuance; pure code drowns us in boilerplate.\r\n\r\nKalo breaks the gradient: we define truth once in declarative, human-readable specs (YAML \/ JSON \/ OpenAPI), then chain modular compile plugins that generate all downstream artifacts like Go structs, TypeScript models, SQL migrations, docs - keeping every layer in lock-step. Result: faster delivery, zero drift, and a plugin marketplace where anyone can add new targets without touching domain code.",

            "description":" Imagine enhancing your existing web2 processes with blockchain\u2014without a complete system overhaul. In this talk, I'll first introduce four pragmatic blockchain design patterns that show how to integrate blockchain into everyday business processes: from time stamping and transparent on-chain data aggregation to tokenizing simple assets and enforcing asset rules. Then, we'll shift gears to explore how these patterns align with modern architectural styles like event-driven systems and microservices. You'll see how blockchain can serve as an auditing module in a microservices setup or be incorporated into event streams in an event-driven design. Join me to learn practical ways to add blockchain capabilities to your existing systems.",

            "description":"Event streams are central to delivering actionable insights for analytics and AI. However, without rich metadata to contextualize these streams, data consumers often struggle with inconsistencies, poor quality, and a lack of interpretability. By leveraging metadata as a cornerstone of event stream architecture, organizations can unlock clarity in their streaming data, bridging the gap between raw event streams and actionable insights. This clarity not only enhances the quality and usability of event streams but also ensures alignment between developers, analysts, and AI systems, enabling them to extract maximum value from data in motion.\r\n\r\nThis session explores how rich metadata transforms event streams into a reliable foundation for advanced analytics and AI workflows. We will examine the role of schema definitions, semantic annotations, and cataloging practices in improving data quality and context.",

JavaScript of course!\r\n\r\nThis session takes a close look at the most awful features in JavaScript and the DOM, how they work and why they are still part of today's web standards. We explore the reasons for continued browser support of even the most broken features from the cretaceous period, how bad decisions from the 1990s still haunt JavaScript's syntax today and which absurd hacks from ancient history are still being re-purposed even today.\r\n\r\nApart from sheer shock and\/or entertainment value, even the most awful anti-features in JavaScript are actually worth learning about. Sometimes they are important constraints for the continued evolution of the JavaScript standard, and sometimes they are simply the only way to solve (extremely specific) programming challenges. If you ever wanted to know why JavaScript works and looks like it does or just like to gawk at some rather... exotic code, this is the session for you!",

Shape Up is an alternative product development methodology pioneered by Basecamp, designed to address the pitfalls of traditional agile and waterfall approaches. The session dives into how Shape Up structures work in six-week cycles, promotes empowered teams, and minimizes the chaos of backlogs and constant reprioritization.\r\nWe'll walk through our journey implementing Shape Up. Why we made the switch, how we adapted the principles to our organization, and what lessons we learned along the way. You'll gain insights into how shaping, betting, and building work together to create more meaningful and autonomous delivery cycles.",

ML is an advisor, training numerous independent models for each individually collected metric to achieve anomaly detection based on recent behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen multiple independent metrics exhibit anomalies simultaneously, it is usually a signal that something unusual is occurring.

I'll also provide Lambda functions performance (cold and warm start times) benchmarking for:\r\n \r\n    -Deployment package sizes \r\n    -Lambda memory settings\r\n    -Java compilation options\r\n    -Managing Lambda dependencies with Lambda layers \r\n    -Choice of garbage collection algorithm\r\n    -Choice of hardware architecture x86 vs arm64 \r\n    -HTTP (a)synchronous clients ",

This talk examines the architectural reasons behind that breakdown\u2014why transformer-based models struggle with intent, structure, and impact when reviewing code - and how reasoning phases, memory, and reflection improve both precision and trust. Using real-world examples from Baz's code review agent, we'll show why prompt engineering isn't enough, and what it takes to move from generic pattern-matching to useful, reliable feedback in large, evolving codebases.

As your setup grows, keeping everything consistent, trackable, and easy to roll back becomes a challenge. In this hands-on workshop, we\u2019ll show how GitOps with ArgoCD can help bring order to the chaos by managing your Kubernetes deployments through Git.\r\nWe\u2019ll kick things off with a quick intro to GitOps principles and the key features of ArgoCD. Then we\u2019ll jump into a live, cloud-based environment where you\u2019ll work with a real Git repo hooked up to a Kubernetes cluster. Together, we\u2019ll explore how Git-based workflows and ArgoCD\u2019s automation handle app rollouts, config updates, drift detection, and self-healing. You\u2019ll push pull requests, watch ArgoCD sync changes in real time, and see what a solid GitOps setup looks like in action.\r\nExpect to leave with practical experience you can take straight to production.",

I will discuss how the requirement for constant IP checking creates a performance bottleneck, and how seemingly minor factors like crawler behavior and old clients can significantly impact system stability.

Highlighting tools like Sora and Midjourney, we delve into techniques like Latent Diffusion Models, which combine text understanding with denoising processes to create and edit media.\r\n\r\nA detailed look at video generation with Sora illustrates how it compresses and reconstructs visual data into final videos. We also discuss alternatives like RunwayML and SunoAI to showcase a wide range of tools for image, audio, and video generation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you\u2019ll gain a foundational understanding of diffusion models, an overview of generation tools, and insights into their functionality.

Endless unit tests for trivial code create a false sense of security while ignoring the areas that matter most\u2014like how your system behaves when it really counts. This session takes a hard look at what makes a good testing strategy. Instead of chasing meaningless metrics like 100% coverage, learn how to test behaviors, focus on integration points, and embrace a leaner, smarter approach to quality assurance. Your users don\u2019t care about how many tests you\u2019ve written\u2014they care about software that works. This is your guide to writing fewer tests, but better ones, that actually make a difference.\r\n",

In this demo-filled session, we\u2019ll show you how to install RHEL on WSL2 and use it to develop a Linux-based Python application. We\u2019ll also have a look at the capabilities of RHEL image builder and demonstrate how you can build a WSL2-ready developer image that runs in WSL2 and lets you use a suite of your favorite Linux and Windows tools in the development process..\r\nThis way of working has been getting harder as systems become more and more distributed. Now, with the advent of AI-driven development, it has become even more challenging than ever before. Many of us use remote generative AI services to help us with scaffolding, writing and testing code, and with many other tasks. \r\n\r\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could still run everything on our local machine? That\u2019s what this session is all about! \r\n\r\nIn this session we\u2019ll take a look at various solutions to continue to do local, network-optional development: \r\nRun AI models locally using different tools such as Ollama, Podman AI Lab, RamaLama, Docker, etc.\r\nEvaluate different code assistants that can work with these locally running models\r\nExplore how to infuse AI capabilities from local models into our code\r\nCompare models from different vendors; and with different sizes to find the right balance between performance and accuracy\r\nWeigh pros and cons of using local vs remote models\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn more about local development while leveraging AI to optimize our development flow, code and our functionality itself!",

Can TypeScript actually provide you with code security benefits? In this session we will explore insecure TypeScript patterns, learn how HTTP parameter pollution vulnerabilities impact TypeScript code bases and witness first-hand how attackers employ prototype pollution attacks that cripple codebases even when developers use schema validation libraries like Zod. Through hands-on coding we\u2019ll hack a TypeScript application and learn security best practices.",

The talk ends with a juxtaposition to OOP, so you not only learn how to employ DOP but also when (not).\r\n",

Imagine a world where hundreds of AI agents interact with humans globally, generating hundreds and thousands of conversations per hour. \r\n\r\nBuilding such a system at scale requires a robust, well-designed architecture. As microservices need Event-Driven Architecture(EDA) to scale beyond fragile point-to-point connections, AI agents need a similar architectural shift. \r\n\r\nThis talk demonstrates a practical approach to building production-ready distributed AI agents beyond simple reactive systems. Through a real-world example, the hands-on live demo will showcase a scalable event-driven architecture for AI agents using Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nEDAs are the future of Agentic AI.

But how do we ensure that our code can be effectively tree-shaken and minimised? \r\n\r\nThere are common code patterns that break tree-shaking and prevent minification from doing much at all. Let me share practical insights from my experience optimising a component library that will help you do the same and shed the excess from your bundles.\r\n\r\nThe talk is split into 2 halves: tree-shaking \/ minification. \r\n\r\nWill explain tree-shaking then show coding patterns that prevent the bundler from being able to drop code. \r\nWill then cover sideEffects \/ pure code annotations.\r\nThen how to test tree shaking is working and demo source-map-explorer.\r\n\r\nThen will cover minification and how to optimise what the bundler can minify. #private variables unlock great savings but there are issues with downleveling for older build targets. \r\n\r\nThe talk finishes with a quick overview of different build tools and the speed \/ size trade off.

While excelling at I\/O, Node's event loop can be blocked by a single CPU-intensive task, leading to catastrophic performance degradation and systems that fail to scale. How can developers overcome this fundamental challenge to build truly responsive applications?\r\nThis hands-on workshop provides the answer. Forget passive lectures; prepare to roll up your sleeves and code through a series of progressive challenges. We will begin by experiencing the problem firsthand, building a server that buckles under a demanding workload. From that starting point, you will systematically refactor, benchmark, and progress toward sophisticated, production-ready, multithreaded solutions. You will leave with not just theory, but the hard-earned confidence to implement these powerful concurrency patterns in your projects.\r\n\r\nWorkshop requirements:\r\n1. A working laptop with administrator credentials.\r\n2. Having Node.js installed (preferibly with https:\/\/github.com\/nvm-sh\/nvm o similar). Versions 20.18.0+ or 22.5.0+ are the minimum we need.\r\n3. A working code editor (VSCode, NeoVim, Intellij\u2026 etc).\r\n",

Behind the scenes, the most successful studios use advanced AI, real-time data streaming, behavioral baselining, and even kernel-level monitoring to detect, deter, and defeat bad actors at scale. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, game designer John Romero explores the frontline of anti-cheat systems, not just as defensive tools for fair play, but as living models for modern cybersecurity design. Drawing on decades of experience building iconic games and securing live environments, John shares how gaming\u2019s arms race against cheaters has produced innovations with wide application across tech. From anomaly detection and player telemetry to predictive modeling and scalable AI deployment, this session breaks down how game developers are solving problems that look a lot like cybersecurity, and what both communities can learn from each other.

The mystical and magical thing your C# compiler does with your code when you hit the compile button, also known as \"compiler sugar\".\r\n\r\nThe session aims to give you an understanding of what happens with your code and how you can predict certain behaviors (outcome-wise as well as performance-wise). Also, we will discover why certain constructs don't \"really\" exist (like var, using, lock, Pikachu, ...). So where are they?\r\n\r\nWe will also misuse some of the patterns to do some trickery every production code needs! After the session, you will have a better understanding of what is going on in the compiler process.",

Within ZEISS, over 6,000 developers worldwide drive innovations across a wide range of areas, including cloud applications, IoT, embedded systems, AI, and data solutions.\r\n\r\nThis diversity presents various challenges, both in the development of specific products and in the more general developer experience. These challenges involve managing large volumes of complex data, providing the necessary service infrastructure, monitoring and optimizing that infrastructure, and implementing AI technologies. All of this is done with the consideration that ZEISS developers are working on \"not just\" software, but also on cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we will explain how our AI-driven platform engineering strategy creates a more agile and efficient development ecosystem that fosters innovation across various industries and addresses the stated challenges.\r\n\r\nThis platform, which is based on Kubernetes and Azure, provides a powerful foundation for self-service capabilities that allow developers to deploy applications seamlessly. By integrating Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and a robust governance framework, we ensure that our systems are resilient and compliant.\r\n\r\nThe experiences gathered in the process of creating our platform is what we want to share. We focus in the talk on demonstrating, through a real-world example, how relieving developers in such a complex environment can look by creating \"paved paths\" - standardized workflows that enhance productivity and reduce friction.\r\n",

Covering topics like TTL, tolerated staleness, caching scope, error handling and revalidation.\r\n\r\nThere are more headers that HTTP offers to control the behavior of the cache. Headers like \"Vary\" to set cache variations. Or \"Etag\" and \"If-None-Match\" to perform conditional revalidation. And also \"Surrogate-Capability\" and \"Surrogate-Control\" to perform edge compute logic and handle edge-side includes.\r\n\r\nAnd while this is not a Varnish-specific presentation, I will be using Varnish as the implementation to showcase the power of HTTP's built-in caching capabilities.",

This session dives into adversarial techniques that challenge the assumptions of AI\/ML models. By introducing noise, obfuscating data, and exploiting algorithmic learning cycles, we can uncover hidden biases and vulnerabilities in AI systems. These techniques push the boundaries of ML training, offering developers a toolkit for crafting more resilient models.\r\n\r\nBeyond improving AI, these techniques offer a unique avenue for achieving digital anonymity. Whether you want to obfuscate your online footprint or prevent data collectors from profiling you, adversarial inputs provide a practical path forward. In this session, attendees will learn how adversarial methods can transform vision and NLP models, empower individuals to take control of their privacy, and showcase live demonstrations of these disruptive strategies in action.",

The presentation provides a practical insight into the development and use of robotic process automation (RPA) in the Deichmann Group. It will shed light on the technological foundations, economic effects and use cases that are already leading to efficiency gains today. For us, RPA is more than just a tool for automating repetitive tasks - it is a strategic lever for relieving employees and increasing process quality. We use use cases to demonstrate its use in data processing, reporting and system integration. The next evolutionary stage is agentic AI: autonomous, AI-controlled agents that perform tasks, make decisions and adapt. In combination with generative AI, new possibilities arise, e.g. in forecasting, text creation, customer communication and campaign automation. The presentation shows how Deichmann is already using these technologies today and which organizational, ethical and technological issues play a role in this",

In this talk, we will demonstrate the difference between the three modes and show the advantages to use the agent mode. In agent mode, Copilot will iterate on not just its own output, but the result of that output. And it will iterate until it has completed all the subtasks required to complete your prompt. Instead of performing just the task you requested, Copilot now has the ability to infer additional tasks that were not specified but are also necessary for the primary request to work.\r\n",

Kai uses the power of LLMs to generate code changes to resolve identified incidents. It eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs. Instead, it augments the knowledge of LLMs with Konveyor data through prompt engineering (few shots) and the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

While they may seem functional at first glance, many users with disabilities encounter a maze of invisible walls, from keyboard traps to inaccessible CAPTCHAs. It's as if GLaDOS designed these forms herself to test us!\r\n\r\nIn this practical walkthrough, we will debug the accessibility issues of a real React login component live, similar to traversing those test chambers: Using an actual screen reader, we'll show how small improvements, such as proper ARIA implementation and effective focus management, can transform a complex test chamber into a smooth user experience. Additionally, we will address the common pitfalls that GLaDOS might throw at us in both the Portal universe and the real world of accessibility. So grab your portal gun\u2014let's work together to break down these barriers and ensure that authentication truly works for everyone. The cake might be a lie, but accessibility doesn't have to be!",

SolidJS introduced Signals specifically for this purpose. Angular has also adopted this concept to track state changes reactively and update the DOM with pinpoint accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn Angular, Signals serve as the synchronization mechanism between JavaScript and the browser DOM, replacing the currently used Zone.js library in the future.\r\n\r\nAs a reactive API, Signals are also well-suited for client-side state management. The most popular libraries in the Angular ecosystem come from the NgRx namespace.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a brand new client-side state management approach that builds on this foundation while leveraging modern browser APIs.\r\n",

In this hands-on workshop, you explore that question using Yellow Teaming, a product development framework inspired by Red Teaming. But instead of testing what might go wrong, Yellow Teaming uncovers the unintended consequences when things go right and how to address them. \r\n \r\nRooted in responsible AI principles and built for real-world use, Yellow Teaming is easy to adopt. Bring a laptop and a product idea. You'll create your own AI Yellow Teaming assistant using a Llama model on a private server or a public LLM like ChatGPT and use it to identify risks and spark innovative product features.  \r\n \r\nAfter this workshop, you'll leave with a stronger, more competitive, and more trusted product concept than the one you came with. \r\n\r\n*All workshop attendees are required to bring their own laptop*",

Instead of easing burdens, it has inundated developers with noisy alerts, straining the relationship between development and security teams, and ultimately putting the burden back on security.  This session will provide examples of how successful teams have addressed this issue and highlight the concept of using secure guardrails that notify (but don\u2019t block) developers in their native workflow and promote the use of secure defaults.

So, is enterprise integration really dead? Not exactly! In this session, we\u2019ll talk about how AI-infused applications and tool-calling agents are redefining the concept of integration, especially when combined with the power of Apache Camel.\r\nWe will discuss the the role of enterprise integration in an era where Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-driven automation can interpret business needs, handle routing, and invoke Camel endpoints with minimal developer intervention. You will see how these AI-enabled systems help weave business data, applications, and services together giving us flexibility and freeing us from hardcoding boilerplate of integration flows.\r\nYou\u2019ll walk away with:\r\nAn updated perspective on the future of \u201cintegration\u201d in a world driven by AI, LLMs, and intelligent agents.\r\nReal-world examples of how tool-calling functionality can transform Camel routes into dynamic, adaptive workflows.\r\nCode examples how to merge AI capabilities with Apache Camel to deliver flexible, event-driven architectures at scale.\r\nRoadmap strategies for integrating LLM-powered agents into your enterprise, orchestrating services that previously demanded complex, rigid solutions.\r\nJoin us to see why rumours of integration\u2019s relevancy have been greatly exaggerated\u2014and see first hand how Camel, powered by AI, is quietly reinventing how we connect the enterprise.",

Arm's vision is to enable this intelligence to run efficiently everywhere. This talk outlines the technical architecture needed to support advanced AI on Arm CPUs and accelerators. It will highlight the strategic role of open source tools in unifying the currently fragmented AI software landscape. At the core is a PyTorch model for which training and inference is accelerated with tools such as vLLM, Ray and oneAPI that optimize everything from matrix operations to data pipelines and distributed workloads. Ultimately, this open ecosystem approach unlocks faster innovation, greater developer velocity, and reliable deployment at scale and ensures that AI stack evolves in sync with the hardware. Open source collaboration allows the industry to pool its efforts on common tooling, avoiding duplicated work and ensuring that breakthroughs benefit everyone. ",

But working with gRPC load balancing can be a bit tricky as you have to use a different set of tools for testing (e.g. grpcurl instead of curl), the return codes are different and things like unary calls vs. streams require a good understanding of the protocol and its implications. We will give an overview of the protocol, explain what load balancing options we have using examples of AWS Load Balancers. We will explain how to perform functional and performance testing and finally go through some common pitfalls when Load Balancing gRPC.",

I mean, in most cases this is the case (lucky us).\r\n\r\nThat's why I hate to break it to you: not all elements are automatically accessible just because they are semantic. Some HTML elements do not have browser or screen reader support by default. The same applies to some HTML attributes, which should be used with caution.\r\n\r\nLet's take a closer look at some of these elements, what they are, why they are not accessible, and what you can do to make them accessible.",

This talk cuts through the noise to explore the technical foundations that make these systems revolutionary for applications beyond cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nWe'll examine the evolution of consensus mechanisms from Bitcoin's resource-intensive Proof of Work to modern approaches like Hedera's asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance. You will learn about topics like data structures, smart contracts, tokens, zero-knowledge proofs, and other innovations that enable today's applications.\r\n\r\nThe session highlights real-world implementations delivering value now, from asset tokenization to supply chain verification. We'll explore how the convergence of distributed systems with AI is laying the foundation for new economic models and industry transformations, so developers can build distributed applications that deliver utility rather than speculation",

            "description":"When I first started programming, debugging unexpected behavior was frustrating\u2014until I discovered unit testing. Testing not only validated my work but also improved my code\u2019s structure. However, as I gained experience, I found that overly complex tests sometimes made things worse. Messy unit and integration tests obscured what was actually being tested, making failures difficult to diagnose and eroding trust in the tests themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore how to harness the power of testing without unnecessary complexity. Using JUnit and Mockito, I will demonstrate how to write clear, purposeful tests that align with what you truly need to validate. We will also discuss how writing testable code naturally leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and more readable code.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you will have a reliable testing strategy that simplifies development and improves code quality\u2014whether you are new to testing or struggling with complex test setups.",

            "description":"After leading engineering teams through multiple transformation initiatives, I've learned that one of the biggest misconceptions in our industry is that shipping secure software has to create delivery friction. This session challenges the traditional \"develop slow, test lots\" mentality by exploring how positioning security and reliability at the beginning of your software development workflow can accelerate delivery. \r\n\r\nDiscover how automated security and reliability checks, integrated into your CI\/CD pipeline, transform security from a bottleneck into a driver for increased release speed. Learn practical strategies for embedding security-first thinking into modern software systems and hear examples of how teams have shifted security left to ship secure software faster.\r\n",

We will discuss how CRaC operates within the Java ecosystem, its integration with Spring, and how you can use it in your own applications for near-instant startup times.\r\n\r\nFrom this talk you will learn what is possible to CRaC and what is not, what are the benefits and limitations, and what is the cost of CRaC-ing.",

For example, the familiar trade-offs between consistency, high availability, and partition tolerance still exist. Remote data access will still incur speed-of-light network delays.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe the inner workings of distributed databases and how to design applications to best exploit their power. Using Oracle and other distributed databases as examples, we will explore the capabilities and unique application challenges posed by distributed databases.

We will explore why traditional search methods fall short in grasping user intent and address the common problems users face with ambiguous search queries.\r\n\r\nLearn how GenAI generates embeddings to capture the context and semantics of queries, and how vector search optimizes these embeddings using Couchbase. This talk though is not only about the theory. In the talk you will be shown practical examples of how to generate embeddings, and how to set up vector indexes.\r\n\r\nSee how these advanced search capabilities can transform user interaction and, as a result, business outcomes, making user uncertainty into certainty with GenAI and vector search.

In this session, we'll take you through the end-to-end journey of building an autonomous Raspberry Pi-based robot that can spot a red hat and drive straight toward it. Starting with a vision model trained on diverse images of hats, we\u2019ll explore how to serve ML models efficiently using Kubernetes. Setting up Skupper then allows us to have secure service communication to the robot.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll show how a Python application interfaces with the robot's camera and the object recognition service to convert visual detection into real-world motion control. \r\n\r\nFinally, we\u2019ll demonstrate how to package both the app and ML services into an ARM image with Tekton Pipelines and deploy it directly to the robot via ArgoCD GitOps - enabling it to run fully autonomously without cloud dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a developer, ML engineer, or Kubernetes enthusiast, you\u2019ll leave with practical insights on building intelligent edge devices that bridge the gap between software pipelines and physical automation.",

Until now, this path has practically always led to the cloud\u2014but it doesn't have to be like that! Currently, various promising approaches exist to running AI models directly on the user's computer. With WebLLM and Chromium's new Prompt API, we can now bring Large Language Models to your Angular app: locally and offline-capable. The W3C's Web Neural Network API (WebNN) will grant AI models access to the device's Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The advantages of these approaches are obvious: Locally executed AI models are available offline, the user data does not leave the device, and all this is even free of charge thanks to open-source models. In this talk, Christian Liebel, Thinktecture's representative at W3C, will present the approaches to make your single-page app smarter. We will discuss use cases and show the advantages and disadvantages of each solution.",

            "description":"Artificial intelligence increasingly shapes our societies. As systems gain autonomy, one central question arises: Who bears ethical responsibility for algorithmic decisions?\r\n\r\nAre developers merely responsible for building systems with a \"kill switch\"\u2014and using it in emergencies\u2014or is that even possible? Should they instead proactively embed a moral compass into their code? This keynote explores how developers can integrate ethical responsibility into real-world practice.\r\n\r\nThrough case studies\u2014from algorithmic bias to autonomous vehicles and generative AI\u2014we examine how ethical principles can be applied early in development. We'll discuss international frameworks and hands-on tools for responsible AI.\r\n\r\nDevelopers, tech leads, and decision-makers are invited to see ethics not as a constraint but as a driver of innovation. The real decisions aren\u2019t made by the code itself\u2014but by those who write it.",

Using code generators for the client and server side code parts makes sure the data is always transferred in the correct shape.\r\n\r\nSince APIs are often the lines along wich we split up teams, working API first is a great strategy to decouple them.",

Modern IDEs already hint at the need: all the useful bits work hard to turn text in files into graphs or abstractions. We search, link, build graphs, reformat, and re-model. It's not just IDEs, even humans spend most of their time reading code just to re-model it in their heads.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine one possible jump. All functions, classes and statements are distributed abstractions in a graph. Dependencies become fungible instead of hard-wired. Better yet, we can use AI fulfill ad-hoc statement of intentions by summoning new packages into existence. Imagine a possible future where every particle of code is shared and written by countless unknown authors, human or otherwise. Be amazed as we escape dependency hell and make AI a productive yet invisible collaborator.",

Fast forward to now: HR is scrambling for defining great use cases, finding high-value items to build, and cashing in on the promises we believed to be true, when we first saw generative AI tools. There is one major reason for this problem. We, as HR professionals, never actually left \"consumption mode\". We are still hoping for someone to show us the light. But generative AI is a general purpose technology. We, in HR, need to be the one's finding the light by understanding the technology, really understanding the employees' pain points with our processes and offerings, and then crafting solutions that are tailored to these pain points. \r\n\r\nAnd here's the clou: HR can leverage ChatGPT as a key to more general AI competence. But only, if we start experimenting and applying the technology proactively. \r\n\r\nI will share how I have done that.",

            "description":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently become increasingly popular. These models can be incorporated into your enterprise code to enhance the customer experience or automate business operations.\r\n\r\nIn any use case involving AI, you\u2019ll rapidly encounter the concept of an AI agent, the code responsible for determining the following steps. LangChain4J is an example of implementing AI agents, a sequence of Java calls and logic interacting with a model. For simple use cases, it might work, but step by step, as the code becomes more complex, you\u2019ll end up with unmaintainable spaghetti code with business logic and AI logic mixed together.\r\n\r\nTools like LangGraph4j offers a structured and efficient framework for defining, coordinating, and running multiple LLM agents using cyclical graphs.\r\n\r\nCome to this session to learn how graph networks can help you implement advanced use cases and explore their integration with LangChain4j to create robust, efficient, and versatile AI applications.\r\n",

No gate gymnastics, no low-level headaches - just an elegant, high-level approach to become Comfortably Quantum.\r\n\r\nP.S.: can you count how many Pink Floyd references will be included in the talk? \ud83c\udfb8",

            "description":"In today\u2019s world, products are no longer standalone artifacts; they are systems... complex ones. A loud speaker, for example, is no longer just a piece of hardware but an ecosystem of hardware, software, machine learning and services designed to work together seamlessly. If this system thinking isn\u2019t embedded at the very beginning of the idea and discovery stage, the result is fragmentation, frustration, and failure of good customer experience and customer satisfaction. On the one hand, we talk about AI, on the other hand we fail to deliver a device with an app that simply just works perfectly. \r\n\r\nThis speech will explore how companies born in the pre-digital era can adopt a systems mindset to stay competitive with their software and integrated solutions on the top of their hardware offering. Through case studies and actionable insights, I\u2019ll uncover why leaders with connected and intelligent products excel and how others can achieve the same results. ",

Game dev isn\u2019t just about creating fun or entertainment\u2014it\u2019s a methodology, a mindset, and a powerful design philosophy that\u2019s been quietly influencing everything from AI to education to digital interaction. In this talk, Johanna Pirker will explore how the tools and thinking behind game development aren\u2019t just part of the entertainment industry\u2014they\u2019re the future of tech itself. By looking at how games have already started to shape areas like user experience, smart cities, healthcare, and even AI, we\u2019ll uncover why play is the next superpower every developer should embrace. The future past has arrived, and it\u2019s time to think like a game developer to build tomorrow\u2019s world, today.",

Towards achieving this\r\n\"quantum advantage\", a larger number of Qubits is required,\r\nleading inevitably to a more complex topology of the\r\ncomputing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates.\r\nNevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\r\n(NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic\r\nuncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to\r\nutilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts\r\nare required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful\r\ncomputations. In this presentation we introduce Quantum DevOps which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. ",

It unexpectedly took off, with 15,000 emails sent in the space of two weeks, helping the Bill overwhelmingly succeed in the normally-socially-conservative upper House of Parliament in the UK.\r\n\r\nHe'll talk here about how he did it, and how you - an individual with a computer and knowledge of how to knock an app together - can use this skill to give a voice to the voiceless, and to potentially change or even save the world.",
